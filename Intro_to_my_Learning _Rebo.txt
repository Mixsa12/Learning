This repo will house random Python and R scripts. Nothing here will blow anyone's mind. 

This place will mostly serve as a playground for me to learn git and documentation for scripts. 

Many of these scripts will come from Udemy courses and other online places.   

What you will find here are:

- Titanic Data Project (In Progress)- This is a project that is part of a Udumy course taught 
by Jose Portilla called "Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization."   

- empty folders

- a lot of drafts
